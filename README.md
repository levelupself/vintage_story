mod ideas for vintage story
1. fuzzy finder for vs command inputs
2. Tab auto complete for vs command inputs, should hilight characters typed and provide a list 
3. macros - save location point to a spot, will auto-name
4. rimworld-esque progression
   a. psychic activates or deactivates trai
   b. traits activated by achievements, like kill 1000 wolves gain +1 damage against wolves or .5 damage from wolves, get an extra berry, find more seeds, etc.
   c. skill level like valheim/rimworld you gain level in skills by doing, skill degradation
   d. a trait menu
   e. a skill display
6. dungeon crawler loot items
7. deserts mod, ice cream, the works
7. outgoing damage, it'd be also nice to have the numbers show over the creatures head
8. damage type and status effect, piercing, blunt chance of stun, daze on head and slow on hitting legs, slashing bleed effect limbs chance to cripple, 
9. if animal is bleeding, it should show a trail of blood
10. tracking skill, can see footprints of an animal as it gets closer becomes more red
11. xSkills is nice, but it'd be nicer if doing the skills also increased the stats
